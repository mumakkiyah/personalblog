Title 
    Personal blog project

WHY
    1. A great way to practice coding in Python, Flask specifically  
    2. A segway to improving my writing and thinking senses

WHAT
    - A database-driven web-app
    - Simple dynamic UI

    * Initial features includes:
        Index: landing page with nav b, latest articles, 
                    header and footer
        Archive: list of articles in cards w/title  
        Article page: detailed page of the article  
        About: content-block resume, past projects, hobbies/interests,
                social-media handles
        Contact: a basic mailto: link

    * Next iteration:
        > search on index page
        > article card with img and title in Archive page
        > comment & like/dislike on article page
        > pagination or lazy-load on Archive page
        > a basic contact-me form in Contact page
        > Admin page with content editor w/basic functionality

HOW
    * Tech Stack
        - HTML5
        - CSS: Bootstrap
        - Python: Flask for endpoint development / back-endpoint
        - Database: MySQL DB
    * Hosting
        > AWS or Google App Engine
            1. DB instance
            2. App hosting 
            3. File storage 

Considerations
    > Cost: how much am I willing to pay to host for the sake of practicing?
    > Content creation: given that content has to be inserted into DB manually, consider a scalable database table design. 
    > Formatting: article formatting will be restricted to header, sub-header, 
                  and entire paragraph, during the initial release without any img blocks.
